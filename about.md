I'm JÃ©ssica and I live in Germany since 2016. I come originally from Fortaleza, Brazil. I've also spent almost a year living in Torino, Italy, during an exchange program.

I'm a software engineer, mainly working with Backend (Go/Python). To me is very satisfying to achieve things through code.

I love music; everything that touches me emotionally and has melodic keyboards/guitars - to me does not matter so much which genre. I like getting myself lost in books, nature or in a nice conversation with someone. I like yoga as well and I'm in the hopes that I can practice it more regularly.

I want to write here in this blog what goes through my mind, what I feel like. It can be just random thoughts, it can be tech-related, it can be something I experienced. But for me, the main goal is to start writing in German as well (who knows, maybe one day I can be comfortable with this language!).
