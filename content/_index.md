### :cherry_blossom: :lotus_position_woman: :fairy_woman:

I'm Jéssica, born in the sunny Fortaleza/Brazil and living in Germany since 2016.
I'm a software engineer, mainly working with Go and with interest in distributed systems, monitoring and all things observability.

I love music; everything that touches me emotionally and has melodic keyboards/guitars - to me does not matter so much which genre. I like getting myself lost in books, nature or in a nice conversation with someone. I like yoga as well and I’m in the hopes that I can practice it more regularly.

I want to write here in this blog what goes through my mind, what I feel like. It can be just random thoughts, it can be tech-related, it can be something I experienced. But for me, the main goal is to start writing in **German** as well (who knows, maybe one day I can be comfortable with this language!).
