  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I live in Germany since Jan/2016. 2 days after I’ve arrived in Berlin, I’ve had experienced snow for the second time in my life (being the first one in Turin - Italy). I remember how happy and fascinated I was in seeing how the streets turned white. How the trees, that before wouldn’t have any leaves, got covered by a thin and smooth layer of snow. In 2016 it didn’t snow a lot: but it was enough to make me happy and delighted.</p>

<p>My 2021 started (a little bit) similar. But this time, with a lot more snow!
On January 2nd, I went to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rh%C3%B6n_Mountains">Rhön mountains</a>, together with my boyfriend and his family. I had no idea about the place beforehand: I only knew I would (hopefully) see some snow on that day.</p>

<p>Being used to the warm and constant weather from Fortaleza, my hometown, of course anything that comes close to snow instantly grabs my attention :D</p>

<p>So there it was: mountains, snow, and kids sliding down mountain slopes. The views were breathtaking and I think that was the best way to start the year and truthfully enjoy the cold months around here.</p>

<p>On the same day I was coming back to Berlin and ready to start the year.
The weeks were passing by and all I could see through my apartment window were days filled with cloudy skies.</p>

<p>But last week was different. Temperatures started to drop (even more!) and yes, snow was coming! We were also presented with a lot of sun and blue skies. My lunch breaks were filled with walks around my neighborhood, where I could enjoy the views of the Panke canal and the Humboldthain Park.</p>

<p>After about a week of negative temperatures, some of the nearby lakes started to freeze. Last weekend I went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heiliger_See">Heiliger See</a>, in Potsdam. It was amazing to see that, the very same lake I went inside for the first time on my birthday (that is during summer), was completely frozen!</p>

<p>To be honest I was a little bit scared. Who knows what could happen? What if the frozen surface breaks down and I fell into the lake, like in the movies?</p>

<p>After checking that it seemed relatively safe, I decided to go. And I think it was amazing! I saw a lot of people ice skating and even some improvised ice hockey fields.</p>

<p>On Sunday I went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wei%C3%9Fer_See_%28Berlin%29">Weißen See</a>, a lake relatively close to where I live. This one seemed even more frozen than the one in Potsdam - it is also a smaller one.
Again I’ve seen a lot of people having fun and even some “sliding paths” that were built spontaneously.</p>

<p>This was the best gift I could receive in the last weeks. I live here for 5 years and I never expected to see Berlin covered by snow and its lakes being frozen like that!</p>
